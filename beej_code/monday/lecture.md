Bonus information (not required for the week at all):
Writing an OS from scratch tutorial: https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial
The Design of the UNIX Operating System by Maurice J. Bach--the algorithms that exist in an OS.

The Elements of Computing Systems by Nisan and Schocken. This book starts with a particular numeric operation (NAND) and uses that one operation to build an entire computer. This is the book for learning architecture, IMHO.  Companion website: https://www.nand2tetris.org/

Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment by W. Richard Stevens. This is a book about how to write software that interfaces directly with the UNIX OS (Linux/BSD/MacOS).
